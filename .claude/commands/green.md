**GREEN Phase: Make the Test Pass**

Now let's make the failing test pass with the SIMPLEST code possible:

1. What's the minimum code needed to make this test pass?
2. Implement ONLY what's needed - no more
3. Run the test to verify it passes
4. Run ALL tests to ensure nothing broke

**Remember:**
- Write the simplest thing that could possibly work
- Don't add features not yet tested
- Avoid premature optimization
- It's okay if the code isn't perfect - we'll refactor next

Once all tests are green, we can move to /refactor or /commit-behavior
