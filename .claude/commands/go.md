description: "Find next test in plan.md and implement it following TDD"
---

Follow the TDD Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

1. Read plan.md and find the next unmarked/uncompleted test
2. Write the failing test (Red)
3. Implement the minimum code to make it pass (Green)
4. Run all tests to confirm they pass
5. Refactor if needed while keeping tests green
6. Mark the test as completed in plan.md

Remember:
- Write the simplest code that could possibly work
- Don't implement features not yet tested
- Keep the feedback loop tight
