**RED Phase: Write a Failing Test**

Following TDD's first step, let's write a test that fails:

1. What small behavior/feature do you want to add next?
2. Write a test that describes this behavior clearly
3. Use a descriptive test name (e.g., "shouldCalculateDiscountCorrectly")
4. Run the test to confirm it fails with a clear error message

**Remember:**
- Test ONE small thing at a time
- Make the test failure informative
- Don't write implementation code yet
- The test should fail for the RIGHT reason

After the test fails properly, we'll move to the Green phase with /green
